                <li>If you are outdoors: stay in the open and away from power lines. Stay away from buildings or anything that might fall.</li>
                <li>If you are in a car stay in the car until the earthquake stops.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Don't try to use matches or light a fire.</li>

        <h2>What to Do After an Earthquake?</h2>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>Check yourself and those around you. Perform first-aid if needed.</li>
            <li>Check water, gas and electric lines for damage.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>If damaged, turn of valves. If you smell gas, open windows and doors and leave immediately.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Turn on the radio and don't use your phone unless you have to.</li>
            <li>Stay away from beaches. Tsunamis and seiches sometimes hit after the ground has stopped shaking.</li>
            <li>If you're at school or work, follow the emergency plan or the instructions of the person in charge.</li>
            <li>Expect aftershocks.</li>
